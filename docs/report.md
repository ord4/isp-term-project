# MyLine - An Interactive Timeline Editor
Internet Systems Programming term project by Orion Davis and Tim Synder

### Introduction
MyLine is an interactive editor that allows uers to edit and view their own custom made timelines.  This application can be used to detail event itineraries, historical events, or other times where a timeline makes communication simple.  The application can be found on Pausch at the link <a href="http://pausch.cs.uakron.edu/~ord4/prj/login.php">http://pausch.cs.uakron.edu/~ord4/prj/login.php</a>.

### Implementation
To implement MyLine the backend server logic was written using PHP and MySQL Database.  The database lives on The University of Akron's servers for students and requires a university connection to properly connect to the database (it should also be noted that a university connection is also needed to use the application on Pausch).
